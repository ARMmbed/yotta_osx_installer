yotta is a tool that we're building at [mbed](https://mbed.org), to make it
easier to build better software written in C, C++ or other C-family languages.
It's still early in development, so if you have questions/feedback or issues,
please [report them](https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta/issues).

### Installation
yotta is written in
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/), and is
installed using [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html).
Install yotta itself by running:

```bash
pip install yotta
```

**Note that yotta needs several non-python dependencies to be installed
correctly in order to do anything useful.** Please follow the **[detailed
installation instructions](http://docs.yottabuild.org/#installing)** on the
yotta docs website to ensure you have a working installation.

Exactly which other dependencies (such as compilers and other build tools) are
required will also depend on the [yotta target
description](http://docs.yottabuild.org/tutorial/targets.html) that you intend
to use, so please be sure to also check the target description's own
documentation.

### Get Started!
The best way to get started is to [follow the
tutorial](http://docs.yottabuild.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### What `yotta` does
yotta downloads the software components that your program depends on. It's
similar in concept to npm, pip or gem: although because C and C++ are compiled
languages, yotta also controls the build of your software in order to ensure
downloaded modules are available to use in your code.

To install a new module, you run `yotta install --save <modulename>`, and yotta
will install both the module you've specified and any of its dependencies that
you don't already have installed. It will also update your module's description
file to reflect the new dependency.

The best way to really understand how yotta works is to [follow the
tutorial](http://docs.yottabuild.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

### Further Documentation
For further documentation see the [yotta docs](http://docs.yottabuild.org)
website.

### Tips
 * `yt` is a shorthand for the `yotta` command, and it's much quicker to type!
 * yotta is strongly influenced by [npm](http://npmjs.org), the awesome node.js
   software packaging system. Much of the syntax for module description and
   commands is very similar.
